1. A daemonSet ensures that all(or some) nodes run a copy of a pod
2. It is typically used for running background services or monitoring agents on every node, such as logging, monitoring, or network services.
   - running a cluster storage daemon on every node
   - running a logs collection daemon on every node
   - running a node monitoring daemon on every node

==========================================================

Explanation of Key Sections:
1. DaemonSet:
 - The DaemonSet ensures that the New Relic agent runs on all nodes in your cluster.
 - The newrelic/infrastructure-k8s image is used to deploy the New Relic agent.

2. Environment Variables:
 - NRIA_LICENSE_KEY: This is the New Relic license key required to authenticate the agent. It’s stored in a Kubernetes secret for security reasons.
 - NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME: Set to the node’s name so that the agent reports as the correct node in New Relic.

3. Volumes:
 - The agent needs access to the host file system (/host) and the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) to collect infrastructure data.

4. SecurityContext:
 - The agent needs privileged access to the host system to collect metrics, so privileged: true is set.

5. Node Selector and Tolerations:
 - The DaemonSet is configured to run only on Linux nodes.
 - Tolerations allow the DaemonSet to run on master nodes if needed.

6. ServiceAccount:
 - The DaemonSet runs using a service account (newrelic-agent), which can be further configured with RBAC permissions if needed.

7. Secret:
 - The New Relic license key is stored as a Kubernetes secret. Replace <YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_BASE64_ENCODED> with your actual New Relic license key, base64 encoded.
